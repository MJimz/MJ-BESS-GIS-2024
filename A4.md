Relevance: Provides the base map for the georeferencing. Observations: the information obtained is from 2021 and the article is from 2023, which could mean 

### 3 and 4. Georeference 
Created four points and ran the georeferencing process with: 
- *Geometry type:* point
- *Projection:* EPSG 25830
- *Type:* Integer 32 bits

### 5. Points 
Created a new GPKG layer with 100 points and updated the attribute table to include 1 count of nest box per point
### 6. Categorize parcels
Categorized parcels in 7 classes by area size. I could not figure out the units from the attribute table and transform them into meters. I used the measure tool to see how much it was in meters using the cartesian projection:
